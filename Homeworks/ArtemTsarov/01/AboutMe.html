		<h4>Hello everyone, my name is Artem.
			I have been attracted to HTML programming since an early age. For a long time I wrote a server for a computer game in HTML, adding models to the server, scripts and much more, HTML was used everywhere. I also entered the university due to the desire to learn this more and more. Unfortunately, due to the situation in the world, my studies were interrupted at the end of my second year. However, now I want to complete my studies.
