I am a motivated and ambitious Front-end Developer who enjoys solving complex problems and helping my team to succeed. I am naturally inquisitive and methodical in my thinking, always aiming to break down problems into small achievable actions. I am looking for opportunities where I can continue to learn, whilst solving real-world problems with a team of ambitious people.
